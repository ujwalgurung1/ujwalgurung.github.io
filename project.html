<p class="projecttext"><span style="font-weight: 200;">UK Housing - The Unintended Impact of Policy </span> 
<p class="projecttext"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Do house prices & homeownership affect Social Mobility? </span> 
  <p class="projecttext"><span style="font-weight: 700;"></span> 
<br>

This project aims to analyse the impact of housing on social mobility.
The findings have interesting implications for government policy.
However, several factors affect social mobility and therefore the project aims to build on this one area.

<p class="projecttext">
  This section presents the spread of house prices in the UK.
  It is clear to see that there exists a large disparity in the distribution of the prices in England.  
  Regions such as London and the Southeast have benefited the most from an increase in prices.
  I also made an interactive chart that can be found <a target=”_blank” href="https://datascienceproject2000.herokuapp.com/working" style="color: #53d9d1;">here</a>
  which presents the increase in prices over time in England.

  The code is fully automatic. The code pulls data from the governemnt website and cleans the data to be merged with the Geojson file and outputs a Geojson file which can be direclty uploaded to Kepler.
  The code used selects the most recent data available.
  I used the Bokeh library to make my app which is hosted on Heroku.
  The Python code can be accessed in my <a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/ujwalgurung1/Property" style="color: #53d9d1;">Property Repository</a>.

<p class="projecttext">
  Rising house prices are also causing a housing affordability crisis in other countries, but at the same time they are increasing homeowners’ wealth. 
  Governments are faced with the challenge to encourage households to build up housing wealth while also promoting access to affordable housing. 
  Housing is the principal source of household wealth in most countries around the world. 
  Households in the top of the wealth distribution hold more diversified portfolios, less wealthy households own mostly housing and least wealthy households own virtually nothing with some even is net debt.

  The data was obtained manually from the OECD. However, the database in the OECD had many gaps in between years.
  The poor API integration on the website also mean that it was difficult to obtain data using XML requests.

<p class="projecttext">
  It comes to no surprise that countries with higher homeownership rates display lower wealth inequality. 
  In a static perspective housing flattens the wealth distribution and reduces inequality.

    The R-Squared values of the regressions of the portions of wealth was 0.02 and 0.23. 
    However, other studies have shown a closer relationship with higher R-Squared values.
    The difference can be explained by the lack of data where I lack a Bottom 40% share of wealth value.

  The data is very replicable. The python script can be run yearly with downloaded from the World Inequality Database.
  Once downloaded the Python code will clean data and produce a Trelis chart. 
  The code utlises the BeautifulSoup library on Python to scrap data from Wikipedia. 
  Although Wikipedia is used the data is reliable. 
  This is as the majority of the data is derived from Eurostat, Trading Economics & the UN Population Fund which can be found in reports.
  I had to use Wikipedia as there are not a lot of sources that provide data of all the countries required.

<p class="bodyText" style="font-size: 30px;"><span style="color: 53d9d1; font-weight: 700;">Homeownership and Social Moblity </span></p><br>
<p class="projecttext">
  Promoting homeownership has long been a policy objective. 
  This has often been justified on grounds that homeownership can help households accumulate wealth and save for retirement.
  However, governemnt policies tend to have unwanted effects such as impacting social mobility.
  Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals either up or down the socioeconomic ladder, 
  such as a low-income family moving up to become a part of the middle class.
  The <a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/ujwalgurung1/ujwalgurung1.github.io/blob/main/project/charts/EuroOwnership%26Mobility.json" style="color: #53d9d1;">chart</a> shows that countries with high levels of of social mobility exhibit lower levels of home ownership.

  The data is very reliable as it is derived from the Social Mobility Commission. The last report was from 2017 and so the values may not be up to date.

<p class="bodyText" style="font-size: 30px;"><span style="color: 53d9d1; font-weight: 700;">Conclusion</span></p><br>
<p class="projecttext">
  To conclude home ownership and Social Mobility are weakly negatively correlated. 
  Even if wealth inequality is lower where homeownership is more widespread, 
  encouraging homeownership is not the appropriate policy response to help low and middle-income families accumulate wealth.
  Promoting residential mobility is an important policy challenge, especially in England where there is a large price gap between regions. 
  This means that there could be labour market–skills mismatches where people from lower house price regions cannot move to a higher one. 
  Mobility can cushion labour-market shocks and reduce regional inequalities – for instance by alleviating local imbalances between labour demand and supply and by promoting the optimal match between workers and jobs. 
  This project stimulates further in the fact the School score aspect of the overall score showed a higher albeit still weak link. 
  This relationship should be explored further.
