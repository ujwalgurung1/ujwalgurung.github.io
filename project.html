<p class="projecttext"><span style="font-weight: 200;">UK Housing - The Unintended Impact of Policy </span> 
<p class="projecttext"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Does House Prices & Home Ownership affect Social Mobility? </span> 
  <p class="projecttext"><span style="font-weight: 700;"></span> 
<br>

This project aims to analyse the impact of housing on social mobility.
The findings have interesting implications for government policy.
However, several factors affect social mobility and therefore the project aims to build on this one area.

<p class="projecttext">
  This section presents the spread of house prices in the UK.
  It is clear to see that there exists a large disparity in the distribution of the prices in England.  
  Regions such as London and the Southeast have benefited the most from an increase in prices.
  I also made an interactive chart that can be found <a target=”_blank” href="https://datascienceproject2000.herokuapp.com/working" style="color: #53d9d1;">here</a>
  which presents the increase in prices over time in England.

  The code is fully automatic. The code pulls data from the Land Registry website and cleans the data to be merged with the Geojson file and outputs a Geojson file which can be directly uploaded to Kepler.
  The code used selects the most recent data available.
  I used the Bokeh library to make my app which is hosted on Heroku.

<p class="projecttext">
  Rising house prices are also causing a housing affordability crisis in other countries, but at the same time they are increasing homeowners’ wealth. 
  Housing is the principal source of household wealth in most countries around the world. 
  Households in the top of the wealth distribution hold more diversified portfolios, less wealthy households own mostly housing and least wealthy households own virtually nothing with some even is net debt.

<p class="projecttext">
  The data was obtained downloaded manually from the OECD. The database in the OECD had many gaps in between years.
  The poor API integration on the website also meant that it was difficult to obtain data using XML requests.
  The code can be found <a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/ujwalgurung1/ujwalgurung1.github.io/blob/main/project/code/WealthComposition.ipynb" style="color: #53d9d1;">here</a>

<p class="bodyText" style="font-size: 30px;"><span style="color: 53d9d1; font-weight: 700;">Link between Homeownership with Inequality </span></p><br>
<p class="projecttext">
  It comes to no surprise that countries with higher homeownership rates display lower wealth inequality. 
  In a static perspective housing flattens the wealth distribution and reduces inequality.
  The code can be found <a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/ujwalgurung1/ujwalgurung1.github.io/blob/main/project/code/Wealth.ipynb" style="color: #53d9d1;">here</a>
  . I created the Trellis chart using Plotly Express to produce an interactive chart.

    The R-Squared values of the regressions of the portions of wealth was 0.02 and 0.23. 
    However, other studies have shown a closer relationship with higher R-Squared values.
    The difference can be explained by the lack of data where I lack a Bottom 40% share of wealth value.
    Looking at the Bottom 50% share higher homeownership rates seems to be related to a higher share of wealth.
    The regressions were created using the scikit-learn library which uses Machine Learning to provide a fit of the observations.

  The python script can be run yearly with downloaded data from the World Inequality Database.
  Once downloaded the Python code will clean data and produce a Trellis chart. 
  The code utilises  the BeautifulSoup library on Python to scrape data from Wikipedia. 
  Although Wikipedia is used the data is reliable. 
  This is as the majority of the data is derived from Eurostat, Trading Economics & the UN Population Fund which can be found in reports.
  I had to use Wikipedia as there are not a lot of sources that provide data of all the countries required.
  The code for the regressions and scraping can be found <a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/ujwalgurung1/ujwalgurung1.github.io/blob/main/project/code/Wealth.ipynb" style="color: #53d9d1;">here</a>

<p class="bodyText" style="font-size: 30px;"><span style="color: 53d9d1; font-weight: 700;">Homeownership and Social Mobility </span></p><br>
<p class="projecttext">
  Promoting homeownership has long been a policy objective. 
  However, government policies tend to have unwanted effects such as reducing social mobility.
  Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals either up or down the socioeconomic ladder, 
  such as a low-income family moving up to become a part of the middle class.
  The <a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/ujwalgurung1/ujwalgurung1.github.io/blob/main/project/charts/EuroOwnership%26Mobility.json" style="color: #53d9d1;">chart</a> shows that countries with high levels of social mobility exhibit lower levels of home ownership.

  There seems to be clustering of observations which could be further investigated and filtered for a tighter fit.

<p class="projecttext">
  The data is very reliable as it is derived from the Social Mobility Commission. The latest report was from 2017 and so the values may not be up to date.
  The results could have been improved if we split the data into "city" and "non-city" regions or other such characteristics.
  A Kepler Map for Social Mobility is available <a target=”_blank” href="project/charts/KeplerMoblity.html" style="color: #53d9d1;">here</a>

<p class="bodyText" style="font-size: 30px;"><span style="color: 53d9d1; font-weight: 700;">Conclusion</span></p><br>
<p class="projecttext">
  To conclude Home Ownership and Social Mobility at best can be considered weakly correlated. 
  Even if wealth inequality is lower where homeownership is more widespread, 
  encouraging homeownership is not the appropriate response to help families accumulate wealth.
  Residential mobility is an important, especially in England where there is a large price gap between regions. 
  This could result in labour market–skills mismatches where skilled people from lower house price regions cannot move around.
  This project stimulates further research as the School score aspect of the overall Mobility score showed a higher albeit still weak link.
