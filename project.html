<h3>UK Housing - The Unintended Impact of Policy</h3>

<p class="projecttext"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Have house price increases affected Social Mobility </span> 

<br>

This project aims to analyse the impact of house prices on social mobility.
The findings have interesting implications for government policy.
However, several factors affect social mobility and therefore the project aims to build on this one area.

<p class="projecttext">
  This section presents the nature of the increase in prices.
  As you click through the time bar it is clear to see that there exists a large disparity in the distribution of the appreciation in England.  
  Regions such as London and the Southeast have benefited the most.

  The interactive chart above provides details on the median price of a home in English Regions across time.
  After exploring different approaches such as Folium and Plotly, I found Python and the Bokeh library to be the most straightforward.
  The application is hosted on Heroku and the Python code can be accessed in my <a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/ujwalgurung1/Property" style="color: #53d9d1;">Property Repository</a>.
  The UK Land Registry API was only limited to outputting data that that was not relevant other APIs were proprietary in nature. 
  Therefore users can download that data and run the map code meaning that the can be reliably reproduced.

<p class="projecttext">
  Rising house prices are also causing a housing affordability crisis in other countries, but at the same time they are increasing homeowners’ wealth. 
  Governments are faced with the challenge to encourage households to build up housing wealth while also promoting access to affordable housing. 
  Housing is the principal source of household wealth in most countries around the world. 
  Households in the top of the wealth distribution hold more diversified portfolios, less wealthy households own mostly housing and least wealthy households own virtually nothing with some even is net debt.

  The data was obtained from the OECD. However, the database in the OECD had many gaps in between years.
  The poor API integration on the website also mean that it was difficult to obtain data using XML requests.

<p class="bodyText" style="font-size: 30px;"><span style="color: 53d9d1; font-weight: 700;">Section 3: Homeownership </span></p><br>
<p class="projecttext">
  Countries with higher homeownership rates display much lower wealth inequality. 
  Being the most widely held asset, housing flattens the wealth distribution and reduces inequality in a static perspective. 
  Although the R-Squared value of the regression was only 0.016, academic literature palces this at 0.41.
  This difference can be explained due to the lack of data most notiably that more relvant data such as the Bottom 30% could not be obtained from the website.
  This would likly show a stronger link.
  homeownership has a wealth-equalising effect.

  The data is very replicable. The python script can be run yearly with downloaded from the World Inequality Database.
  Once downloaded the Python code will clean data and produce a Trelis chart.
  The code utlises the BeautifulSoup library on Python to scrape data from Wikipedia. 
  Although Wikipedia is used to scrape for more information the data is reliable. 
  Appropraiate to use Wikipedia as there are a variety of sources that only offer data for a set amount of countries.
  The majority of the data is derived from Eurostat, Trading Economics & the UN Population Fund which can be found in published reports.

<p class="bodyText" style="font-size: 30px;"><span style="color: 53d9d1; font-weight: 700;">Section 4: </span></p><br>
<p class="projecttext">
  We have estalished link between homeownership rates and wealth inequality.
  Promoting homeownership has long been a policy objective. 
  This has often been justified on grounds that homeownership can help households accumulate wealth and save for retirement, as well as contribute to well-being and social cohesion.
  However, governemnt policies tend to have unwanted effects. One such factor includes social mobility.
  Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals either up or down the socioeconomic ladder relative to their current standing, 
  such as a low-income family moving up to become a part of the middle class.
  Countries with high levels of social mobility exhibit lower levels of income inequality 
  and provide more equally shared opportunities for its citizens.
  It can be argued that a high ownership environment in the UK has priced out many others who seek to move into 
  areas of high economic opportunities such as London and other cities. this phenomenon 
  is also know was geographical immoblity.
  Notes: people born into low-income families, regardless of their talent, or their hard work, do not have the same access to 
  opportunities as those born into more privileged circumstances. As poorer people priced out of capital 
  move into country with lower quality away.

  UK chart looks at local adminstartive regions, we could have fixed on if locations were in city or not as there could be 
  city effects mainly due to price of perporty

<p class="projecttext">
  This is bad a labour cannot relocate casuing ineffeicient labour markets research more into this.
  Althouhg no automatic fetches due to data being obtained from published reports the 
  frequency of report means this is not a problem.
  However, for replicability the codes I have programmed can be run with raw data which is then cleaned by the code.
